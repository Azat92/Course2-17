FMDB, UISearchController, CoreData and UISplitViewController

This is a demo project which contains some examples of [FMDB](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb) usage (with 
[FTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_text_search)). 
Also here you can find one of the possible ways to integrate 
[UISearchController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UISearchController/)
to your project.

Next commits contains information about CoreData base usage. It covers initial project setup for CoreData, 
creating entities and managing relationships between them. You can find example of creation and deletion of
managed objects, as well as automatic migration usage.

Also, the final version contains UISplitViewController, that works well on all iPhone and iPad devices
(including multitasking mode).
